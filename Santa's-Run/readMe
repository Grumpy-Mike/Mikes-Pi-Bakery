This contains information and downloads for Santa's Run

A shaker, made from a plastic drinks bottle and tilt switch, is used to power Santa on a run across the screen and back. Based against the real sky star and moon positions of midnight on Christmas eve 2020, and screen shots for every issue, he has to deliver all 100 issues of the MagPi down the chimneys. 

From the MagPi No. 100 December 2020.
