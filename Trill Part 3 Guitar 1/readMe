This contains information and downloads for Trill part 3 - Trill Guitar 1

This part describes the hardware needed to make a Pi Pico Trill Guitar and the drawings to cut out the housing.

The project is entirely written in MicroPython.
The software here allows you to test the three major aspects of the hardware
1) The trill touch sensors
2) The OLED display
3) The MIDI output

It also includes an updated Trill sensor library updated to work with MicroPython

The project uses the stand alone Pico controller to make a touch Guitar.

The video shows various photos of the construction along with a small sneak preview of the whole thing in action. 
Next month we will see how the software works and how it can be customised.
