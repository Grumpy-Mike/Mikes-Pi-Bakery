At the time of writing (26th August 2021 ) there is an error in the AdaFruit MIDI library, in that it will not send correctly a Program Change ( change of voice ) MIDI Message. It actually sends 0x0 as the first byte of the message and not 0xCn, where n is the channel number.

I have raised an issue about this and it has been investigated but still not fixed. It is likely that the error is somewhere else in the overall code and not the MIDI library.

If you require this feature in your project then I would advise you hold fire and wait until / if  it is fixed before starting to make the project.


You can track this by looking at:-

UPDATE 24th October 2021

This was a two part problem, initially there was an error in Circuit Python 6 that caused that. It was fixed in Circuit Python 7.
However, Circuit Python 7 introduces some changes that broke the main code concerning the OLED handling. Each time there was a message like:-

displayio.Group(max_size=21, scale=1, x=0, y=42)

There was an error of too many arguments. It was the max_size argument that was deprecated, so for each call like this you had to use:-
displayio.Group(scale=1, x=0, y=42)
in its place.
The code here has been changed to reflect this.

The second part of the error is that even with the change to Circuit Python 7 the Program Change would not work correctly. This was traced down to the OS version I was using on my Mac laptop. Apparently using macOS Mojave V10.14.6 still resulted in the error. I have tested it on an iMac running macOS Big Sur V11.6 and it works correctly.
