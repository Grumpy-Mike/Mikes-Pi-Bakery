Hex Keys is an Isomorphic MIDI keyboard with a USB device interface. The case and keys were cut on a Laser Cutter and the electronics built on strip board. Published in The MagPi Magazine #108 August 2021.
With an Isomorphic keyboard the pattern of notes to play any chord is the same for any key, making it much easier to learn.
Part 1 shows the construction, with Part 2 (next month) showing the full working system.
