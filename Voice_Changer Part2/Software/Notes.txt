Notes on running.
The pico-voice.uf2 can simply be dropped into the Pico's boot loader window.

The build directory is empty to save space when storing and transferring.

To compile open up a terminal window and type:-

cd pico-voice/build
cmake
make

This assumes that the pico-voice files are at the same directory level as your Pico C SDK install.
