[Verse 1]

       G                    C

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go

    G                 C

I'm standing here outside your door

  G                C             D

I hate to wake you up to say goodbye

        G                     C

But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,

    G                    C

The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn

  G                C            D

Already I'm so lonesome I could die

 

[Chorus]

   G           C

So kiss me and smile for me

G                   C

Tell me that you'll wait for me

G                   C             D

Hold me like you'll never let me go

    G       C

I'm leaving on a jet plane

G                  C

   Don't know when I'll be back again

G     C              D

  Oh babe, I hate to go

### note after this it simply repeats with new words so just make your set end here ### 

[Verse 2]

           G               C

There's so many times I've let you down

   G               C

So many times I've played around

  G            C                 D

I tell you now they don't mean a thing

      G               C

Every place I go I'll think of you

      G                C

Every song I sing I'll sing for you

     G                C                  D

When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

 

[Chorus]

   G           C

So kiss me and smile for me

G                   C

Tell me that you'll wait for me

G                   C             D

Hold me like you'll never let me go

    G       C

I'm leaving on a jet plane

G                  C

   Don't know when I'll be back again

G     C              D

  Oh babe, I hate to go

 

[Verse 3]

G                C

Now the time has come to leave you

G             C

One more time let me kiss you

     G               C             D

Then close your eyes I'll be on my way

G               C

Dream about the days to come

     G               C

When I won't have to leave alone

 G              C               D

About the times I won't have to say

 

[Chorus]

   G           C

So kiss me and smile for me

G                   C

Tell me that you'll wait for me

G                   C            D

Hold me like you'll never let me go

    G       C

I'm leaving on a jet plane

G                  C

   Don't know when I'll be back again

G          C         D

  Oh babe, I hate to go
