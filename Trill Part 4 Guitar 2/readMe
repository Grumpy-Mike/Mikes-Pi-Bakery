This contains information and downloads for Trill part 4 - Trill Guitar 2

This part describes the hardware needed to make a Pi Pico Trill Guitar and the drawings to cut out the housing.

The project is entirely written in MicroPython.
The software here allows you to run last month's software as a touch Guitar.


It also includes an example of a song configuration file and an example of a typical song 
in tabular or Tab form with the chord changes above the word or part of a word. 

The project uses the stand alone Pico controller to make a touch Guitar.
